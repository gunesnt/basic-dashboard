# Take Home Test

Hello, I just started that project with `create-react-app`. Also, I decided to use the Material UI for ui implementation. I fixed the global state issue with `Context API` and `useState` hybrid way. This was most challenging part to me. Because, I wanted to solve it with `Hooks` instead of `Redux`. I tried to use the theme system of the Material UI.

## Explaining How To Do This

- For all platform, I generated and optimized the favicon from svg file on [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- I downloaded all the icons as svg. And I removed `fill` attributes for styling easily on CSS.
- I used and implemented the following components of the Material UI to Figma template file:
  - For "sidebar": Drawer
  - For "navbar": AppBar
  - For "header": Toolbar in the AppBar
  - For "content": Cards wrapped with Grid
  - For "activity feed": List

## Used Libraries

- React (16.13.1)
- Material UI (4.11.0)
- Material UI Icons (4.9.1)

## Installation

You can install the packages with this command: `npm i`

## Usage

You can serve and see the result in your local environment with this command: `npm start`
